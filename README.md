# Credit-Risk-Classification


# Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers. By leveraging historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending platform, the model classifies loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1). This predictive capability enables the company to make informed decisions and mitigate financial risks associated with lending activities.

# Methodology

### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
* Gather relevant historical lending data.
* Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and handle missing values.
* Feature engineering may be necessary to create new features that improve predictive power.
### Model Selection and Training:
* Choose a suitable classification algorithm, such as logistic regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train the model on the training set to learn patterns and relationships between features and loan outcomes.
### Model Evaluation:
* Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Results

* Precision:

Precision for a class is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions for that class.

For 0 (healthy loan), precision tells us how many of the predicted healthy loans are actually healthy.
For 1 (high-risk loan), precision indicates how many of the predicted high-risk loans are indeed high-risk.

* Recall:

Recall (or Sensitivity) for a class is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives for that class.

For 0, recall shows how many of the actual healthy loans were correctly predicted.
For 1, recall tells us how many of the actual high-risk loans were correctly predicted.

* F1-Score:

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
A higher F1-score indicates better performance in predicting both classes.


These results suggest that the model effectively identifies both healthy and high-risk loans, providing valuable insights for risk management.

# Recommendations

* Model Deployment: Based on the results, the logistic regression model can be deployed into the company's lending processes to assist in credit risk assessment.
* Model Refinement: Consider exploring other classification algorithms or techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning, to potentially improve the model's performance further.
* Continuous Monitoring: Regularly update the model with new data to ensure its accuracy remains relevant as market conditions and borrower behavior evolve.
* Explainability: Investigate methods to explain the model's predictions, providing transparency and aiding in understanding the factors influencing creditworthiness.

By following these recommendations, the company can leverage the predictive capabilities of the model to make more informed lending decisions and minimize financial risks.
